# Blackjack AutoPlayer with Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project is focused on building a Blackjack game in C++ and integrating a machine learning algorithm to autoplay the game. The goal is to train the algorithm to make optimal decisions, such as whether to "Hit" or "Stand," to maximize the chances of winning.

## Features

### Blackjack Game Implementation
- **Object-Oriented Design**:
  - Classes for `Card`, `Deck`, `Player`, and `Game`.
  - Clear separation of concerns for each component.
- **Core Functionality**:
  - Realistic deck creation, shuffling, and card drawing.
  - Player and dealer actions follow standard Blackjack rules.
  - Scoring system that handles Ace values intelligently.

### Machine Learning Integration
- **Simulated Gameplay**:
  - Generate thousands of game scenarios for training data.
- **Algorithm Development**:
  - Train a model to evaluate game states (e.g., hand value, dealerâ€™s visible card).
  - Predict actions ("Hit" or "Stand") to optimize outcomes.
- **Autoplay Mechanism**:
  - Integrate the trained model to automatically play the game.

## How It Works

1. **Blackjack Logic**:
   - C++ program models the complete game rules, including shuffling, dealing cards, and evaluating scores.
   - Dealer logic: Automatically draws cards until reaching at least 17.
2. **Data Collection**:
   - Simulate games to collect data on actions and outcomes.
   - Save datasets with game state and results for ML training.
3. **Machine Learning Model**:
   - Use supervised learning or reinforcement learning to develop strategies.
   - Train the model to optimize decision-making based on past outcomes.
4. **Integration**:
   - Replace manual player input with model predictions.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- **C++ Compiler**: Required to build and run the game (e.g., GCC, Clang).
- **Python Environment**: For training and testing the ML model (optional).

### Steps to Run the Game
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/blackjack-autoplayer.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd blackjack-autoplayer
   ```
3. Compile the C++ game:
   ```bash
   g++ blackjack.cpp -o blackjack
   ```
4. Run the game:
   ```bash
   ./blackjack
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- **Expanded Rules**:
  - Add support for doubling down, splitting, and insurance bets.
- **Enhanced AI**:
  - Use reinforcement learning to refine strategies over time.
- **Visualization**:
  - Create a graphical interface for better interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: For core Blackjack game implementation.
- **Python**: For developing and training the machine learning model (planned).
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow or PyTorch for model training.
